        4 Types of Luck üçÄ

        Blind Luck - Totally random, where you‚Äôve absolutely no control over it.

        Hustle Luck - This is where you put too much energy into the world, make some noise and shake things a bit, 
        consistently. In turn, things start to happen around you.

        Spotted Luck - You become so good in your field, with a rock solid knowledge base, 
        that you become sensitive to luck. Either consciously or subconsciously, you find luck, 
        or go to places where you‚Äôve high probability of being lucky.

        Magnetic Luck - Here, you become the best in your field and luck finds you. 
        Example‚Äî Someone finds the location of a treasure chest deep into the ocean, 
        and you happen to be a world-class scuba diver. Since they cannot extract it 
        by themselves, they ask for your help in exchange for some percentage of 
        treasure. So their luck becomes your luck.
